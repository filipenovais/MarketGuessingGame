### Overview
MarketGuessingGame is a simulation tool designed to help users develop an intuitive understanding of market trends. It allows players to download and analyze candlestick data for various cryptocurrency markets from Binance, with options to customize the timeframe and number of candles to review prior to making market direction guesses.

### Features
- **Market Data Download**: Retrieve candlestick data for any cryptocurrency listed on Binance.
- **Customization Options**: Set the time step for data, the number of candles to display before guessing, and the number of steps to guess ahead.
- **Price Anonymization**: Choose to view real prices or obscure them with fake ones for a blind guessing challenge.
- **Training Period Selection**: Users can select specific periods to practice and improve their market prediction skills.

### Functionality
Players have the ability to guess future market movements by observing a set number of past candles. They can train over selected periods and strive to achieve higher scores by accurately predicting market direction. Options to reset scores and adjust visibility of prices and dates encourage repeated play and learning.

### How It Works
Upon selecting their data preferences and guessing parameters, users make predictions about market movements. After each guess, the game reveals the actual prices and dates to provide immediate feedback on the userâ€™s intuition. As players continue to engage with the tool, they can track their progress through scores, aiming to develop a sharper sense for market behavior.
